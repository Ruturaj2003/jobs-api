Hereâ€™s the complete project list with your **SkillCrafter** project included:

### Project Ideas

1. **UPI Transactions Management System**: A fee management system for your college with WhatsApp integration. Users send UPI screenshots to a bot, which extracts and verifies UTR numbers before storing them in the database. Includes a dashboard for accountants to filter and manage different fees.

2. **Cafe Helper**: An app that allows customers to request music changes, make custom coffee orders, or place regular orders. The system will confirm custom orders if possible, and customers can call waiters or verify orders through the app.

3. **Personal Portfolio Webpage**: A personal portfolio website to showcase your work, refining your skills through project completion.

4. **Fantasy Reads**: A web app that takes a PDF (book) and displays it line by line with a Harry Potter-style effect. The goal is to reduce distractions by hiding pages left, with a reading speed test included.

5. **Scavenger**: A web app for buying and selling used or antique items. Users can request unavailable items and set their desired price, allowing others to "scavenge" for them. Similar to a small-scale eBay for used products.

6. **Custom Chat App**: A chat app for your college to simplify finding shared resources. Teachers and students use hashtags to categorize topics, making it easier to filter content. Includes a private chat for saving important information.

7. **Restaurant Manager**: A low-interaction system with interfaces for customers, billers, and chefs. Customers can call waiters, manage orders, and get inventory updates, while analytics are provided for better restaurant management.

8. **ResQR**: An emergency response system leveraging QR code technology to enhance medical response. Patients manage their medical profiles and generate QR codes for first responders to access critical information quickly. Focuses on security, data privacy, and integration with India's healthcare initiatives.

9. **SkillCrafter**: A text-based AI tool that generates personalized project ideas based on users' learned skills. Users input their knowledge (e.g., HTML, JavaScript), which is analyzed by a Generative AI API to suggest relevant projects. This tool eliminates the need for a project database, offering flexibility and dynamic suggestions for developers looking to apply their skills in real-world projects.

These projects collectively provide a comprehensive scope for learning and applying various skills while addressing different real-world needs.
